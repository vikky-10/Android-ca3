<!-- ### Concepts implemented in the project -->
<!-- 1. Room Persistence Library - To store Notes created By the User. -->
<!-- 2. Navigation component - To move between different fragments in-app.  -->
<!-- 3. Data Binding - To access the views directly and The accessing of view reduced the overhead and the app performance -->
<!-- increased drastically. -->
<!-- 4. Recycler View - To Display the notes stored By the user -->
<!-- 5. Coroutines - To  perform database related operations asynchronously (Database Operation Include insert/delete/deleteAll/update/retrieve ALl) -->
<!-- 6. Material Design Library - Used throughout the app to maintain Consistency with Android Design Guideline  -->
<!-- 7. Dark Mode (Night Mode) - Saves Battery and Reduces strain on eyes. -->



<!-- ## 🛠 Built With  -->
<!-- - [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development. -->
<!-- - [Room persistence library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) - The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite. -->
<!-- - [Data Binding Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding) - The Data Binding Library is a support library that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically. -->
<!-- - [Material Design](https://material.io/design/) - Material is an adaptable system of guidelines, components, and tools that support the best practices of user interface design. -->
<!-- - [Navigation Components Architecture ](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation)- Android Jetpack's Navigation component helps you implement navigation, from simple button clicks to more complex patterns -->
<!-- - [slidetoact](https://github.com/cortinico/slidetoact) - A simple 'Slide to Unlock' Material widget for Android, written in Kotlin)- A simple 'Slide to Unlock' Material widget for Android, written in Kotlin [Used in app to avoid Accidental deletion of all Notes] -->
